# Representing Fly Behavior with Recurrent Neural Networks

My honors thesis work was on building a behavioral representation with recurrent neural networks in *D. Melanogaster* (the fruit fly). 
All the code for training the networks I used, the preprocessing and resulting data analysis is contained in this notebook 
(although it's a bit messy - sorry I was hustling near the end what with corona & all x). I was in Dr. Gordon Berman's lab at Emory University,
in the Department of Biology (although I completed my honors in physics). 

## Introduction

Representing behavior is hard. Even defining behavior is hard. The field of neuroscience has grown leaps and bounds in the past decade or so; 
quite a bit of work has been put into assembling and analyzing large swaths of neural data [[1]] (#1).
